Implementation of Dempsters Rule (Evidence Theory) for the lecture Knowledge Based Systems

### task
part 1: after every picture the measurements need to be classified with one emotion as an output
part 2: ?

### structure of the data
meaning of columns - see readme in data directory
order of events in the data set:
1. neutral emotion (for 10 seconds?)
2. 3 different emotions for 5 seconds each
3. neutral emotion for 5 seconds
4. unknown emotion for 25 seconds (only classify this one?)

### our approach
each measured feature is a basis measure m_n
all emotions are Omega
